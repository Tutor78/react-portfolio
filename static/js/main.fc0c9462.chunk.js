I was born on Halloween, 1992 in Memphis, Tn. I grew up with my two sisters and parents in a small house in Marion, Ar on the Mississippi river. I spent a lot of my childhood playing sports, riding bikes, and generally spending time outdoors as a part of the Boy Scouts. I attended a private school as a child which helped to grow my leadership, curiosity, and helped me develop a lifelong love of learning. It was at this school where I was first introduced to programming through a robotics program, where I had the pleasure of being one of the first students invited to join. I've used this experience to truly drive my passion for programming and generally all things to deal with computers."}),Object(c.jsx)("p",{className:"about-text",children:"After I graduated high school, I went into the military where I served in San Diego on the USS Comstock as a boatswain's mate. I really fell in love with the sea at that time and learned the true value of hard work. I became a boatswain's mate third class at the ripe old age of 19 and was subsequently put in charge of other sailors. Here I really grew into my own as a self starter and leader as I had the desire to prove myself capable to those around me. After I left the military, I transfered my skills to working offshore where I quickly became a tankerman PIC and picked back up training and leading sailors beneath me. I learned here that I truly thrived in a fast paced environment and after a few years wanted to spend more time at home. This led me to try my hands at a restaurant where I became a bartender quite rapidly. It was here that I got to truly hone my people skills before I finally moved once more into management. But soon I became bored and wanted to be challenged again and moved back into blue collar work as a landscaper which is my current occupation."}),Object(c.jsx)("p",{className:"about-text",children:"That is when I realized that while I enjoy physical work I decided to look at trying to turn one of my passions into a job. At first I decided on attending college to study cyber security as I had always been intriqued by the stories that I had heard. I found the security side of things fun but at times boring and looked at another degree. That's when I settled on studying computer science with a focus on security. That's when I realized that I truly enjoyed programming. At the time I had another passion that began taking up a ton of my time. Music. I began to pour my money and focus into music as I began meeting other musicians. It was at this time that I built a home studio and, under my stage name Mike Tuta, produced and played guitar on a rap song that was released on Spotify. That's when I decided to switch gears and put my schooling on the backburner and began hustling to try and make it big in the industry. This went well for a bit with a bit of local recognition but after a short time I realized that music should remain my hobby, though I have a true passion for it. That's when I decided to try my hand at a coding bootcamp and settled for one that was given through UCF. Currently, I am within a month of finishing and am very happy to say that I truly love programming and building applications and websites."})]})]})},u=a.p+"static/media/musigle.dd5b8675.png",b=a.p+"static/media/password-generator.04230d21.png",g=a.p+"static/media/quizzical.fe626bfa.png",j=a.p+"static/media/rain-man.9ac3ba85.png",p=a.p+"static/media/taskmaster-pro.02eb92fb.png",f=a.p+"static/media/work-day.302b35c3.png",y=(a(16),[{name:"Musigle",img:u,github:"https://github.com/aidanamato/music-search-project"},{name:"Password Generator",img:b,github:"https://github.com/Tutor78/password-generator"},{name:"Quizzical",img:g,github:"https://github.com/Tutor78/quizzical"},{name:"Rain Man",img:j,github:"https://github.com/Tutor78/rain-man"},{name:"Taskmaster Pro",img:p,github:"https://github.com/Tutor78/taskmaster-pro"},{name:"Work Day",img:f,github:"https://github.com/Tutor78/work-scheduler"}]);function x(){return Object(c.jsx)("div",{children:y.map((function(e){return Object(c.jsxs)("a",{className:"card",href:e.github,target:"_blank",rel:"noreferrer",children:[Object(c.jsx)("img",{className:"card-image",src:e.img,alt:e.name}),Object(c.jsx)("p",{className:"card-title",children:e.name})]},e.name)}))})}function O(){return Object(c.jsx)("div",{children:Object(c.jsx)("div",{className:"card-display",children:Object(c.jsx)(x,{})})})}var w=function(){return Object(c.jsx)("div",{className:"component-container",children:Object(c.jsx)(O,{})})},v=a(2),I=a(5);a(17);var k=function(){var e=Object(n.useState)({name:"",email:"",message:""}),t=Object(r.a)(e,2),a=t[0],i=t[1],s=a.name,o=a.email,l=a.message;function d(e){i(Object(I.a)(Object(I.a)({},a),{},Object(v.a)({},e.target.name,e.target.value)))}return Object(c.jsxs)("div",{className:"component-container",children:[Object(c.jsx)("h1",{className:"contact-title",children:"Contact Me"}),Object(c.jsxs)("form",{id:"contact-form",onSubmit:function(e){e.preventDefault()},children:[Object(c.jsxs)("div",{className:"contact-name",children:[Object(c.jsx)("label",{htmlFor:"name",children:"Name:"}),Object(c.jsx)("input",{type:"text",name:"name",defaultValue:s,onChange:d})]}),Object(c.jsxs)("div",{className:"contact-email",children:[Object(c.jsx)("label",{htmlFor:"email",children:"Email Address:"}),Object(c.jsx)("input",{type:"email",name:"email",defaultValue:o,onChange:d})]}),Object(c.jsxs)("div",{className:"contact-message",children:[Object(c.jsx)("label",{htmlFor:"message",children:"Message:"}),Object(c.jsx)("textarea",{name:"message",rows:"5",defaultValue:l,onChange:d})]}),Object(c.jsx)("button",{className:"contact-button",type:"submit",children:"Send"})]})]})},N=a.p+"static/media/resume.2792ecd7.png";a(18);var C=function(){return Object(c.jsxs)("div",{className:"component-container",children:[Object(c.jsx)("h1",{className:"resume-title",children:"Resume"}),Object(c.jsx)("img",{className:"resume-image",src:N,alt:"resume"})]})};a(19);var T=function(){var e=Object(n.useState)("about"),t=Object(r.a)(e,2),a=t[0],i=t[1];return Object(c.jsxs)("div",{className:"container",children:[Object(c.jsx)(d,{setCurrentPage:i}),"about"===a&&Object(c.jsx)(m,{}),"portfolio"===a&&Object(c.jsx)(w,{}),"contact"===a&&Object(c.jsx)(k,{}),"resume"===a&&Object(c.jsx)(C,{})]})},M=function(e){e&&e instanceof Function&&a.e(3).then(a.bind(null,21)).then((function(t){var a=t.getCLS,n=t.getFID,i=t.getFCP,s=t.getLCP,o=t.getTTFB;a(e),n(e),i(e),s(e),o(e)}))};o.a.render(Object(c.jsx)(i.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(c.jsx)(T,{})}),document.getElementById("root")),M()}],[[20,1,2]]]);
